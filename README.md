# php-practice
Practice with php (especially object oriented). Create some functions to answer math based and simple Project Euler questions and some standard interview questions including sorting algorithms.

Games include a command line version of Conway's Game of Life, a text based game Hunt the Wumpus (not done) started in the command line, and a web based implementation of the arcade game Snake (start an apache server with php info settings available and then move the directory to the apache webserver).

Basic webpages for connecting to a database and then sending MySQL queries and displaying the results in a web browser (done in the bookstore directory).
